Hello CodeFellows,
Here is code that I wrote for a client’s geocoding project
1.	The Us Post Office creates a dataset, called AIS, that has every address listed by the post office and carrier route. This information comes in zipped text files. There are no spaces in the files to store the most data. Before using this information, the CD has to be uploaded to the server, the files unzipped and then unpacked. My client’s instructions were “Make it so easy that a monkey could do it”
